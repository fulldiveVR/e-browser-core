  Disable AIWize Talk in AIWize.

  AIWize Talk is a feature that allows users to start private video calls with friends and colleagues directly from the browser.

            If this policy is set to true, AIWize Talk will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, AIWize Talk will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, AIWize Talk will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
